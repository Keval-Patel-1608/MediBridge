# MediBridge - Virtual Healthcare Assistance for Newcomers  

## 🏆 Inspiration  
Moving to a new country comes with challenges, and accessing healthcare is one of the biggest. Many newcomers struggle to find clinics, apply for a health card, or understand medical terms in English or French. We wanted to *bridge this gap* by creating an easy-to-use app that simplifies the Canadian healthcare system for newcomers.  

## 💡 What it does  
MediBridge is a *mobile/web app* designed to assist newcomers in navigating healthcare services. The app provides:  
- 🏥 *Find Nearby Clinics & Hospitals* – Search by location, wait times, and service type.  
- 🩺 *Step-by-Step Healthcare Guides* – Instructions on getting a health card, finding a family doctor, and more.  
- 🤖 *AI-Powered Chatbot (MediBot)* – Answers common healthcare-related questions.  
- 🌎 *Medical Term Translation* – Helps users understand medical terms in their native language.  
- 🚨 *Emergency Contacts* – Quick access to 911, Telehealth, and mental health hotlines.  

## 🔧 How we built it  
- *Prototyped in Adobe XD* – Designed and built an interactive prototype with user-friendly navigation.  
- *Minimalist UI/UX Design* – Focused on accessibility, clear typography, and intuitive interactions.  
- *Interactive Click-Throughs* – Created tap-friendly elements for seamless user flow.  

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into  
- *Time Constraints* – Completing a functional prototype in just 3 hours was challenging.  
- *Feature Prioritization* – We had many ideas but had to focus on the *most impactful* ones.  
- *Simplifying Healthcare Info* – Breaking down complex healthcare processes into easy-to-follow guides.  

## 🎉 Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- *Successfully designed a full prototype* in Adobe XD within the time limit.  
- *Created a practical solution* to help newcomers access healthcare effortlessly.  
- *Developed a clean and modern UI* with accessibility and ease of use in mind.

- How to *rapidly prototype* an app in Adobe XD.  
- The importance of *user-centered design* in healthcare applications.  
- How to *simplify complex information* into an easy-to-digest format.  

## 🚀 What's next for MediBridge
